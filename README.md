# Splashy

Splashy is an Android application that demonstrates the implementation of a splash screen using the `androidx.core:core-splashscreen` library. This app serves as a practice homework assignment to understand splash screen implementation, handling intents, and activity lifecycle in Android.

## Demonstration

## Features

- Display a splash screen when the app is launched.
- Transition from the splash screen to the main activity.
- Demonstrate the usage of intents to navigate between activities.
- Showcase the activity lifecycle callbacks in Android.

## Requirements

- Android device or emulator running Android 5.0 (API level 21) or above.
- Android Studio with SDK tools.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the app on your Android device or emulator.

## Usage

1. Launch the app on your Android device.
2. Observe the splash screen being displayed for a specific duration.
3. After the splash screen disappears, the main activity will be shown.
4. Explore the app's main activity, which can include various features or functionalities based on your implementation.
5. Use intents to navigate between different activities within the app.
6. Observe the activity lifecycle callbacks such as `onCreate()`, `onStart()`, `onResume()`, `onPause()`, `onStop()`, `onDestroy()`, and others as you navigate through the app.

## Libraries Used

- `androidx.core:core-splashscreen:1.0.1`: A library for implementing splash screens efficiently in Android.
